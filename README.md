# OpenglPractice
Just a practice of OpenGL with GLFW3.

## Build

### General
Compile main.c, source/glad.c with the header files in the include folder, then link glfw3.dll.

### MSVC
>If you have MSVC, **open your cmd of this folder**, run **msvc.bat** at first, then run **compile.bat**, then you'll get a release.exe.
>If msvc.bat failed, that because your path of vcvars64.bat is different than mine, open your **x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 20xx**, cd to this folder, **then you can run compile.bat**.
>If you don't like Visual Studio just like me, but still want to use MSVC, you can use Build Tools for [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/zh-hant/downloads/). Scroll down the download page, it is in the "Tools for Visual Studio".
